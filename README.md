# Neighbourhood

Neighbourhood is a web app designed to strengthen local communities by connecting neighbors, fostering communication, and promoting local engagement.
In a world that often feels disconnected, Neighbourhood is a platform that prioritizes proximity, creating a space for neighbors to share ideas, organize events, and support second-hand purchases.
Neighbourhood envisions a world where technology brings people closer together rather than driving them apart. By focusing on local connections, our app aims to revive a sense of community, where neighbors become friends, and communities thrive through shared experiences, support, and collaboration.
